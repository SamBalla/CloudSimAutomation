==================

CloudSim Automation is a Java command line tool based on CloudSim and CloudReports 
classes that is able to read the specification of CloudSim simulation
scenarios from a YAML file, a very human readable data format.
The simulation scenario can be written inside a YAML file
and the Cloud Automation Tool read this scenario specification,
create and run it on CloudSim.
